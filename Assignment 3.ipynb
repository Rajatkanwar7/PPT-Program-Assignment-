    "Early stopping is a technique related to regularization that helps prevent overfitting. Instead of relying solely on regularization penalties, early stopping monitors the model's performance on a validation set during training. Training is stopped when the validation performance starts to deteriorate, indicating overfitting.

By randomly dropping neurons, dropout prevents complex co-adaptations and forces the network to learn more robust representations. It acts as a form of regularization by reducing the model's reliance on specific neurons and improving generalization."

    "#### Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision boundaries in a decision tree can be interpreted based on the attribute tests at each level. At each internal node, the decision tree checks the value of a specific feature and decides which branch to follow based on the outcome of the test. The decision boundaries are defined by the threshold values of the features and the branching logic. The splitting thresholds divide the feature space into regions corresponding to different classes or predicted values. The decision boundaries can be visualized as the boundaries between different regions in the feature space."

Instead of using simple voting or averaging, stacking involves training a meta-model on the predictions of individual models.

Stacking allows the ensemble to capture more complex relationships and can potentially achieve higher predictive accuracy."

Adding more models to the ensemble initially improves performance, but there is a point of diminishing returns where further additions provide little benefit or may even degrade performance. This point can be determined by monitoring the performance on a validation set or using techniques like cross-validation. If the performance plateaus or decreases after adding more models, it indicates the optimal number of models for the ensemble."
