    "Apply data augmentation techniques on the minority class to generate slightly altered versions of existing samples. This can increase the diversity of the minority class and aid model learning.\n",
    "#### 8. Use Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "Treat the imbalanced class as an anomaly detection problem. If the minority class represents rare occurrences or anomalies, consider using anomaly detection techniques.\n",
    "#### 9. Transfer Learning:\n",
    "Utilize transfer learning with pre-trained models to leverage knowledge from related tasks or domains, which can improve the model's ability to generalize.\n",
    "#### 10. Confidence Threshold Adjustment:\n",
